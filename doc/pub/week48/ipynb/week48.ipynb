The following [video attempts at giving an overview on this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Toet3EiSFcM&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer).

    "Friday's lecture is split in two parts. It starts with a summary of\n",
    "what we have done this semester and continues with perspectives for future studies and\n",
    "modern research projects in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support Vector Machines, overarching aims\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed last week, \n",
    "a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a very powerful and versatile\n",
    "Machine Learning method, capable of performing linear or nonlinear\n",
    "classification, regression, and even outlier detection. It is one of\n",
    "the most popular models in Machine Learning, and anyone interested in\n",
    "Machine Learning should have it in their toolbox. SVMs are\n",
    "particularly well suited for classification of complex but small-sized or\n",
    "medium-sized datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The case with two well-separated classes only can be understood in an\n",
    "intuitive way in terms of lines in a two-dimensional space separating\n",
    "the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic mathematics behind the SVM is however less familiar to most of us. \n",
    "It relies on the definition of hyperplanes and the\n",
    "definition of a **margin** which separates classes (in case of\n",
    "classification problems) of variables. It is also used for regression\n",
    "problems.  I recommend you take a look at the lectures from last week on the binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kernels and non-linearity\n",
    "\n",
    "The cases we studied last week  were all characterized by two classes\n",
    "with a close to linear separability. The classifiers we have described\n",
    "so far find linear boundaries in our input feature space. It is\n",
    "possible to make our procedure more flexible by exploring the feature\n",
    "space using other basis expansions such as higher-order polynomials,\n",
    "wavelets, splines etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our feature space is not easy to separate, as shown in the figure\n",
    "here generated by the code below (see also Figures 12.2 and 12.3 of [Hastie et al.](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387848570)), we can achieve a better separation by introducing more complex\n",
    "basis functions. The ideal would be (see Figures 12.2 and 12.3) to, via a specific transformation to \n",
    "obtain a separation between the classes which is almost linear. \n",
    "\n",
    "The change of basis, from $x\\rightarrow z=\\phi(x)$ leads to the same type of equations to be solved, except that\n",
    "we need to introduce, for example, a polynomial transformation to a two-dimensional training set."

    "classification, or ranking. Deep learning has made breakthroughs in\n",
    "computer vision, speech processing and natural language, and reached\n",
    "or even surpassed human level. The success of deep learning is mainly\n",
    "due to the three factors: big data, big model, and big computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past few decades, many different architectures of deep neural\n",
    "networks have been proposed, such as\n",
    "1. Convolutional neural networks, which are mostly used in image and video data processing, and have also been applied to sequential data such as text processing;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recurrent neural networks, which can process sequential data of variable length and have been widely used in natural language understanding and speech processing;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encoder-decoder framework, which is mostly used for image or sequence generation, such as machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning, a repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. \n",
    "In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,\n",
    "and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*\n",
    "is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm \n",
    "of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, \n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.\n",
    "Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Other unsupervised learning algortihms like **Boltzmann machines**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Boltzmann machines?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is known as restricted Boltzmann Machines (RMB) have received a lot of attention lately. \n",
    "One of the major reasons is that they can be stacked layer-wise to build deep neural networks that capture complicated statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original RBMs had just one visible layer and a hidden layer, but recently so-called Gaussian-binary RBMs have gained quite some popularity in imaging since they are capable of modeling continuous data that are common to natural images. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, they have been used to solve complicated [quantum mechanical many-particle problems or classical statistical physics problems like the Ising and Potts classes of models](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.91.045002). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boltzmann Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use a generative model rather than the more well known discriminative deep neural networks (DNN)? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Discriminitave methods have several limitations: They are mainly supervised learning methods, thus requiring labeled data. And there are tasks they cannot accomplish, like drawing new examples from an unknown probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A generative model can learn to represent and sample from a probability distribution. The core idea is to learn a parametric model of the probability distribution from which the training data was drawn. As an example\n",
    "\n",
    "a. A model for images could learn to draw new examples of cats and dogs, given a training dataset of images of cats and dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Generate a sample of an ordered or disordered phase, having been given samples of such phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Model the trial function for [Monte Carlo calculations](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.91.045002).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some similarities and differences from DNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Both use gradient-descent based learning procedures for minimizing cost functions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Energy based models don't use backpropagation and automatic differentiation for computing gradients, instead turning to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DNNs often have several hidden layers. A restricted Boltzmann machine has only one hidden layer, however several RBMs can be stacked to make up Deep Belief Networks, of which they constitute the building blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "History: The RBM was developed by amongst others [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton), called by some the \"Godfather of Deep Learning\", working with the University of Toronto and Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boltzmann machines (BM)\n",
    "\n",
    "A BM is what we would call an undirected probabilistic graphical model\n",
    "with stochastic continuous or discrete units.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interpreted as a stochastic recurrent neural network where the\n",
    "state of each unit(neurons/nodes) depends on the units it is connected\n",
    "to. The weights in the network represent thus the strength of the\n",
    "interaction between various units/nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns into a Hopfield network if we choose deterministic rather\n",
    "than stochastic units. In contrast to a Hopfield network, a BM is a\n",
    "so-called generative model. It allows us to generate new samples from\n",
    "the learned distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A standard BM setup\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard BM network is divided into a set of observable and visible units $\\hat{x}$ and a set of unknown hidden units/nodes $\\hat{h}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally there can be bias nodes for the hidden and visible layers. These biases are normally set to $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "BMs are stackable, meaning they cwe can train a BM which serves as input to another BM. We can construct deep networks for learning complex PDFs. The layers can be trained one after another, a feature which makes them popular in deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, they are often hard to train. This leads to the introduction of so-called restricted BMs, or RBMS.\n",
    "Here we take away all lateral connections between nodes in the visible layer as well as connections between nodes in the hidden layer. The network is illustrated in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The structure of the RBM network\n",

    "## The network\n",
    "\n",
    "**The network layers**:\n",
    "1. A function $\\mathbf{x}$ that represents the visible layer, a vector of $M$ elements (nodes). This layer represents both what the RBM might be given as training input, and what we want it to be able to reconstruct. This might for example be given by the pixels of an image or coefficients representing speech, or the coordinates of a quantum mechanical state function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function $\\mathbf{h}$ represents the hidden, or latent, layer. A vector of $N$ elements (nodes). Also called \"feature detectors\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the hidden layer is to increase the model's expressive\n",
    "power. We encode complex interactions between visible variables by\n",
    "introducing additional, hidden variables that interact with visible\n",
    "degrees of freedom in a simple manner, yet still reproduce the complex\n",
    "correlations between visible degrees in the data once marginalized\n",
    "over (integrated out).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The network parameters, to be optimized/learned**:\n",
    "1. $\\mathbf{a}$ represents the visible bias, a vector of same length as $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $\\mathbf{b}$ represents the hidden bias, a vector of same lenght as $\\mathbf{h}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $W$ represents the interaction weights, a matrix of size $M\\times N$.\n",

    "## Autoencoders: Overarching view\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders are artificial neural networks capable of learning\n",
    "efficient representations of the input data (these representations are called codings)  without\n",
    "any supervision (i.e., the training set is unlabeled). These codings\n",
    "typically have a much lower dimensionality than the input data, making\n",
    "autoencoders useful for dimensionality reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, autoencoders act as powerful feature detectors, and\n",
    "they can be used for unsupervised pretraining of deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, they are capable of randomly generating new data that looks\n",
    "very similar to the training data; this is called a generative\n",
    "model. For example, you could train an autoencoder on pictures of\n",
    "faces, and it would then be able to generate new faces.  Surprisingly,\n",
    "autoencoders work by simply learning to copy their inputs to their\n",
    "outputs. This may sound like a trivial task, but we will see that\n",
    "constraining the network in various ways can make it rather\n",
    "difficult. For example, you can limit the size of the internal\n",
    "representation, or you can add noise to the inputs and train the\n",
    "network to recover the original inputs. These constraints prevent the\n",
    "autoencoder from trivially copying the inputs directly to the outputs,\n",
    "which forces it to learn efficient ways of representing the data. In\n",
    "short, the codings are byproducts of the autoencoder’s attempt to\n",
    "learn the identity function under some constraints.\n",
