    "## Support Vector Machines, overarching aims\n",
    "\n",
    "A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a very powerful and versatile\n",
    "Machine Learning method, capable of performing linear or nonlinear\n",
    "classification, regression, and even outlier detection. It is one of\n",
    "the most popular models in Machine Learning, and anyone interested in\n",
    "Machine Learning should have it in their toolbox. SVMs are\n",
    "particularly well suited for classification of complex but small-sized or\n",
    "medium-sized datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The case with two well-separated classes only can be understood in an\n",
    "intuitive way in terms of lines in a two-dimensional space separating\n",
    "the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic mathematics behind the SVM is however less familiar to most of us. \n",
    "It relies on the definition of hyperplanes and the\n",
    "definition of a **margin** which separates classes (in case of\n",
    "classification problems) of variables. It is also used for regression\n",
    "problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "With SVMs we distinguish between hard margin and soft margins. The\n",
    "latter introduces a so-called softening parameter to be discussed\n",
    "below.  We distinguish also between linear and non-linear\n",
    "approaches. The latter are the most frequent ones since it is rather\n",
    "unlikely that we can separate classes easily by say straight lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperplanes and all that\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory behind support vector machines (SVM hereafter) is based on\n",
    "the mathematical description of so-called hyperplanes. Let us start\n",
    "with a two-dimensional case. This will also allow us to introduce our\n",
    "first SVM examples. These will be tailored to the case of two specific\n",
    "classes, as displayed in the figure here based on the usage of the petal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume here that our data set can be well separated into two\n",
    "domains, where a straight line does the job in the separating the two\n",
    "classes. Here the two classes are represented by either squares or\n",
    "circles."
