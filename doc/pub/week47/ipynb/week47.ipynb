    "The principal component analysis deals with the problem of fitting a\n",
    "low-dimensional affine subspace $S$ of dimension $d$ much smaller than\n",
    "the total dimension $D$ of the problem at hand (our data\n",

    "a geometric problem.  In our discussion of the theorem for the\n",
    "classical PCA, we will stay with a statistical approach. \n",
    "Historically, the PCA was first formulated in a statistical setting in order to estimate the principal component of a multivariate random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a data set defined by a design/feature matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ (see below for its definition) \n",
    "* Each data point is determined by $p$ extrinsic (measurement) variables\n",
    "\n",
    "* We may want to ask the following question: Are there fewer intrinsic variables (say $d << p$) that still approximately describe the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If so, these intrinsic variables may tell us something important and finding these intrinsic variables is what dimension reduction methods do. \n",

    "* **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)** reduces dimensionality while trying to preserve the distances between the instances.\n",

    "* **Isomap** creates a graph by connecting each instance to its nearest neighbors, then reduces dimensionality while trying to preserve the geodesic distances between the instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding** (t-SNE) reduces dimensionality while trying to keep similar instances close and dissimilar instances apart. It is mostly used for visualization, in particular to visualize clusters of instances in high-dimensional space (e.g., to visualize the MNIST images in 2D).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is actually a classification algorithm, but during training it learns the most discriminative axes between the classes, and these axes can then be used to define a hyperplane onto which to project the data. The benefit is that the projection will keep classes as far apart as possible, so LDA is a good technique to reduce dimensionality before running another classification algorithm such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier discussed in the SVM lectures."

    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
