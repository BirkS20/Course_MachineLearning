    "Bagging typically results in improved accuracy\n",
    "over prediction using a single tree. Unfortunately, however, it can be\n",
    "difficult to interpret the resulting model. Recall that one of the\n",
    "advantages of decision trees is the attractive and easily interpreted\n",
    "diagram that results.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we bag a large number of trees, it is no longer\n",
    "possible to represent the resulting statistical learning procedure\n",
    "using a single tree, and it is no longer clear which variables are\n",
    "most important to the procedure. Thus, bagging improves prediction\n",
    "accuracy at the expense of interpretability.  Although the collection\n",
    "of bagged trees is much more difficult to interpret than a single\n",
    "tree, one can obtain an overall summary of the importance of each\n",
    "predictor using the MSE (for bagging regression trees) or the Gini\n",
    "index (for bagging classification trees). In the case of bagging\n",
    "regression trees, we can record the total amount that the MSE is\n",
    "decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all $B$ possible\n",
    "trees. A large value indicates an important predictor. Similarly, in\n",
    "the context of bagging classification trees, we can add up the total\n",
    "amount that the Gini index  is decreased by splits over a given\n",
