    "The principal component analysis deals with the problem of fitting a\n",
    "low-dimensional affine subspace $S$ of dimension $d$ much smaller than\n",
    "the total dimension $D$ of the problem at hand (our data\n",
    "set). Mathematically it can be formulated as a statistical problem or\n",
    "a geometric problem.  In our discussion of the theorem for the\n",
    "classical PCA, we will stay with a statistical approach. \n",
    "Historically, the PCA was first formulated in a statistical setting in order to estimate the principal component of a multivariate random variable.\n",

    "We have a data set defined by a design/feature matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ (see below for its definition) \n",
    "* Each data point is determined by $p$ extrinsic (measurement) variables\n",

    "* We may want to ask the following question: Are there fewer intrinsic variables (say $d << p$) that still approximately describe the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If so, these intrinsic variables may tell us something important and finding these intrinsic variables is what dimension reduction methods do. \n",
