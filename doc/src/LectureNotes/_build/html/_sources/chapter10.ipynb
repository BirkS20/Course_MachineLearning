    "\n",
    "The way the recurrent neural networks are trained in this program\n",
    "differs from how machine learning algorithms are usually trained.\n",
    "Typically a machine learning algorithm is trained by learning the\n",
    "relationship between the x data and the y data.  In this program, the\n",
    "recurrent neural network will be trained to recognize the relationship\n",
    "in a sequence of y values.  This is type of data formatting is\n",
    "typically used time series forcasting, but it can also be used in any\n",
    "extrapolation (time series forecasting is just a specific type of\n",
    "extrapolation along the time axis).  This method of data formatting\n",
    "does not use the x data and assumes that the y data are evenly spaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a standard machine learning algorithm, the training data has the\n",
    "form of (x,y) so the machine learning algorithm learns to assiciate a\n",
    "y value with a given x value.  This is useful when the test data has x\n",
    "values within the same range as the training data.  However, for this\n",
    "application, the x values of the test data are outside of the x values\n",
    "of the training data and the traditional method of training a machine\n",
    "learning algorithm does not work as well.  For this reason, the\n",
    "recurrent neural network is trained on sequences of y values of the\n",
    "form ((y1, y2), y3), so that the network is concerned with learning\n",
    "the pattern of the y data and not the relation between the x and y\n",
    "data.  As long as the pattern of y data outside of the training region\n",
    "stays relatively stable compared to what was inside the training\n",

    "<!-- The idea behind formatting the data in this way comes from [this resource](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/) and [this one](https://fairyonice.github.io/Understand-Keras%27s-RNN-behind-the-scenes-with-a-sin-wave-example.html). -->\n",
    "<!--  -->\n",
    "<!-- The following method takes in a y data set and formats it so the \"x data\" are of the form (y1, y2) and the \"y data\" are of the form y3, with extra brackets added in to make the resulting arrays compatable with both Keras and Tensorflow. -->\n",
    "<!--  -->\n",
    "<!-- Note: Using a sequence length of two is not required for time series forecasting so any lenght of sequence could be used (for example instead of ((y1, y2) y3) you could change the length of sequence to be 4 and the resulting data points would have the form ((y1, y2, y3, y4), y5)).  While the following method can be used to create a data set of any sequence length, the remainder of the code expects the length of sequence to be 2.  This is because the data sets are very small and the higher the lenght of the sequence the less resulting data points. -->"
