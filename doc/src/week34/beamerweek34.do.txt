===== Overview of first week =====

o The sessions on Tuesdays and Wednesdays last four hours for each group (four groups in total) and will include lectures in a flipped mode (promoting active learning) and work on exercices and projects.
o The sessions will begin with lectures, discussions, questions and answers about the material to be covered every week. Videos and teaching material will be announced in due time.
o There are four groups:
  * Tuesdays 815am-12pm and 1215pm-4pm
  * Wednesdays 815am-12pm and 1215pm-4pm.

o On Thursdays we have a regular lecture. These lectures start at 1215pm and end at 2pm and serve the aims of giving an overview over various topics. These lectures will also be recorded.

The labs are also available till 6pm Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Videos and learning material with reading suggestions will be made available before each week starts.

===== Communication channels =====

* Chat and communications via URL:"canvas.uio.no"
* _Slack_ channel: machinelearninguio.slack.com. Will most likely change.


!split
===== Course Format =====

  * Three compulsory projects. Electronic reports only using "Canvas":"https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/education/canvas/" to hand in projects and "git":"https://git-scm.com/" as version control software and "GitHub":"https://github.com/" for repository (or "GitLab":"https://about.gitlab.com/") of all your material.
  * Evaluation and grading: The three projects are graded and each counts 1/3 of the final mark. No final written or oral exam.
    o For the last project each group/participant submits a proposal or works with suggested (by us) proposals for the project.
    o If possible, we would like to organize the last project as a workshop where each group presents this to all other participants of the course
    o Based on feedback etc, each group finalizes the report and submits for grading. 
  * Python is the default programming language, but feel free to use C/C++ and/or Fortran or other programming languages. All source codes discussed during the lectures can be found at the webpage and "github address":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/MachineLearning/tree/master/doc/Programs" of the course.

===== Reading material =====

!bblock
The lecture notes are collected as a jupyter-book at URL:"https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/intro.html".

In addition to the lecture notes, we recommend the books of Bishop, Hastie et al, Murphy and Goodfellow et al. We will follow these texts closely and the weekly reading assignments refer to these texts. The text by Hastie et al is also widely used in the Machine Learning community. Finally, we also recommend the hands-on text by Geron, see next slide.

!split
===== Textbooks =====

!bblock
* "Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville (GBC), Deep Learning":"https://www.deeplearningbook.org/"
* Christopher M. Bishop (CB), Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
* Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (HTF), The Elements of Statistical Learning, Springer, URL:"https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387848570". This is a well-known text and serves as additional literature.
* Aurelien Geron (AG), Hands‑On Machine Learning with Scikit‑Learn and TensorFlow, O'Reilly, https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/. This text is very useful since it contains many code examples and hands-on applications of all algorithms discussed in this course.

===== Reading suggestions week 34 =====

!bblock
This week: Refresh linear algebra, GBC chapters 1 and 2. HTF chapters 2 and 3. Install scikit-learn. See lecture notes for week 34 at https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/web/course.html (these notes).

===== Prerequisites =====

Basic knowledge in programming and mathematics, with an emphasis on
linear algebra. Knowledge of Python or/and C++ as programming
languages is strongly recommended and experience with Jupiter notebook
is recommended. Required courses are the equivalents to the University
of Oslo mathematics courses MAT1100, MAT1110, MAT1120 and at least one
of the corresponding computing and programming courses INF1000/INF1110
or MAT-INF1100/MAT-INF1100L/BIOS1100/KJM-INF1100. Most universities
offer nowadays a basic programming course (often compulsory) where
Python is the recurring programming language.




!split
===== Topics covered in this course: Statistical analysis and optimization of data =====

The course has two central parts

o Statistical analysis and optimization of data
o Machine learning

These topics will be scattered thorughout the course and may not  necessarily be taught separately. Rather, we will often take an approach (during the lectures and project/exercise sessions) where say elements from statistical data analysis are mixed with specific Machine Learning algorithms.


!split

===== Statistical analysis and optimization of data =====

We plan to cover the following topics:
* Basic concepts, expectation values, variance, covariance, correlation functions and errors;
* Simpler models, binomial distribution, the Poisson distribution, simple and multivariate normal distributions;
* Central elements of Bayesian statistics and modeling;
* Gradient methods for data optimization;
* Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings sampling (tentative);
* Estimation of errors and resampling techniques such as the cross-validation, blocking, bootstrapping and jackknife methods;
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its mathematical foundation;


!split
===== Machine Learning =====

* Pre deep-learning revolution (2008 approx)
  * Linear Regression and Logistic Regression, classification and regression problems;
  * Bayesian linear and logistic regression, kernel regression;
  * Decisions trees, Random Forests, Bagging and Boosting methods;
  * Support vector machines (only survey);
  * Unsupervised learning and  dimensionality reduction, from PCA to clustering;  
* Deep learning  
  * Neural networks and deep learning;
  * Convolutional neural networks;
  * Recurrent neural networks;
  * Autoencoders
  * Generative methods with an emphasis on Boltzmann Machines, Variational Autoencoders and Generalized Adversarial Networks;
Hands-on demonstrations, exercises and projects aim at deepening your understanding of these topics.

!split
===== Extremely useful tools, strongly recommended =====

!bblock and discussed at the lab sessions
  * GIT for version control, and GitHub or GitLab as repositories, highly recommended. This will be discussed during the first exercise session
  * Anaconda and other Python environments, see intro slides and links to programming resources at URL:"https://computationalscienceuio.github.io/RefreshProgrammingSkills/intro.html"
