    "of relevance for project 2. \n",

    "During week 41 we discussed three different types of gates, the\n",
    "so-called XOR, the OR and the AND gates.  In order to develop a code\n",
    "for neural networks, it can be useful to set up a simpler system with\n",
    "only two inputs and one output. This can make it easier to debug and\n",
    "study the feed forward pass and the back propagation part. In the\n",
    "exercise this and next week, we propose to study this system with just\n",
    "one hidden layer and two hidden nodes. There is only one output node\n",
