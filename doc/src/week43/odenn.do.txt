===== Ordinary Differential Equations =====

An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is an equation involving functions having one variable.

In general, an ordinary differential equation looks like

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{ode}
f\left(x, \, g(x), \, g'(x), \, g''(x), \, \dots \, , \, g^{(n)}(x)\right) = 0
\end{equation}
!et

where $g(x)$ is the function to find, and $g^{(n)}(x)$ is the $n$-th derivative of $g(x)$.

The $f\left(x, g(x), g'(x), g''(x), \, \dots \, , g^{(n)}(x)\right)$ is just a way to write that there is an expression involving $x$ and $g(x), \ g'(x), \ g''(x), \, \dots \, , \text{ and } g^{(n)}(x)$ on the left side of the equality sign in (ref{ode}).
The highest order of derivative, that is the value of $n$, determines to the order of the equation.
The equation is referred to as a $n$-th order ODE.
Along with (ref{ode}), some additional conditions of the function $g(x)$ are typically given
for the solution to be unique.

!split
===== The trial solution =====

Let the trial solution $g_t(x)$ be

!bt
\begin{equation}
	g_t(x) = h_1(x) + h_2(x,N(x,P))
\end{equation}
!et


where $h_1(x)$ is a function that makes $g_t(x)$ satisfy a given set
of conditions, $N(x,P)$ a neural network with weights and biases
described by $P$ and $h_2(x, N(x,P))$ some expression involving the
neural network.  The role of the function $h_2(x, N(x,P))$, is to
ensure that the output from $N(x,P)$ is zero when $g_t(x)$ is
evaluated at the values of $x$ where the given conditions must be
satisfied.  The function $h_1(x)$ should alone make $g_t(x)$ satisfy
the conditions.

But what about the network $N(x,P)$?


As described previously, an optimization method could be used to minimize the parameters of a neural network, that being its weights and biases, through backward propagation.


!split
===== Minimization process =====

For the minimization to be defined, we need to have a cost function at hand to minimize.

It is given that $f\left(x, \, g(x), \, g'(x), \, g''(x), \, \dots \, , \, g^{(n)}(x)\right)$ should be equal to zero in (ref{ode}).
We can choose to consider the mean squared error as the cost function for an input $x$.
Since we are looking at one input, the cost function is just $f$ squared.
The cost function $c\left(x, P \right)$ can therefore be expressed as

!bt
C\left(x, P\right) = \big(f\left(x, \, g(x), \, g'(x), \, g''(x), \, \dots \, , \, g^{(n)}(x)\right)\big)^2
!et

If $N$ inputs are given as a vector $\bm{x}$ with elements $x_i$ for $i = 1,\dots,N$,
the cost function becomes

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{cost}
	C\left(\bm{x}, P\right) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \big(f\left(x_i, \, g(x_i), \, g'(x_i), \, g''(x_i), \, \dots \, , \, g^{(n)}(x_i)\right)\big)^2
\end{equation}
!et

The neural net should then find the parameters $P$ that minimizes the cost function in
(ref{cost}) for a set of $N$ training samples $x_i$.

!split
===== Minimizing the cost function using gradient descent and automatic differentiation =====

To perform the minimization using gradient descent, the gradient of $C\left(\bm{x}, P\right)$ is needed.
It might happen so that finding an analytical expression of the gradient of $C(\bm{x}, P)$ from (ref{cost}) gets too messy, depending on which cost function one desires to use.

Luckily, there exists libraries that makes the job for us through automatic differentiation.
Automatic differentiation is a method of finding the derivatives numerically with very high precision.


!split
===== Example: Exponential decay =====

An exponential decay of a quantity $g(x)$ is described by the equation

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{solve_expdec}
  g'(x) = -\gamma g(x)
\end{equation}
!et

with $g(0) = g_0$ for some chosen initial value $g_0$.

The analytical solution of (ref{solve_expdec}) is

!bt
\begin{equation}
  g(x) = g_0 \exp\left(-\gamma x\right)
\end{equation}
!et

Having an analytical solution at hand, it is possible to use it to compare how well a neural network finds a solution of (ref{solve_expdec}).


!split
===== The function to solve for =====

The program will use a neural network to solve

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{solveode}
g'(x) = -\gamma g(x)
\end{equation}
!et

where $g(0) = g_0$ with $\gamma$ and $g_0$ being some chosen values.

In this example, $\gamma = 2$ and $g_0 = 10$.

!split
===== The trial solution =====
To begin with, a trial solution $g_t(t)$ must be chosen. A general trial solution for ordinary differential equations could be

!bt
g_t(x, P) = h_1(x) + h_2(x, N(x, P))
!et

with $h_1(x)$ ensuring that $g_t(x)$ satisfies some conditions and $h_2(x,N(x, P))$ an expression involving $x$ and the output from the neural network $N(x,P)$ with $P $ being the collection of the weights and biases for each layer. For now, it is assumed that the network consists of one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer.

!split
===== Setup of Network =====

In this network, there are no weights and bias at the input layer, so $P = \{ P_{\text{hidden}},  P_{\text{output}} \}$.
If there are $N_{\text{hidden} }$ neurons in the hidden layer, then $P_{\text{hidden}}$ is a $N_{\text{hidden} } \times (1 + N_{\text{input}})$ matrix, given that there are $N_{\text{input}}$ neurons in the input layer.

The first column in $P_{\text{hidden} }$ represents the bias for each neuron in the hidden layer and the second column represents the weights for each neuron in the hidden layer from the input layer.
If there are $N_{\text{output} }$ neurons in the output layer, then $P_{\text{output}} $ is a $N_{\text{output} } \times (1 + N_{\text{hidden} })$ matrix.

Its first column represents the bias of each neuron and the remaining columns represents the weights to each neuron.

It is given that $g(0) = g_0$. The trial solution must fulfill this condition to be a proper solution of (ref{solveode}). A possible way to ensure that $g_t(0, P) = g_0$, is to let $F(N(x,P)) = x \cdot N(x,P)$ and $A(x) = g_0$. This gives the following trial solution:

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{trial}
g_t(x, P) = g_0 + x \cdot N(x, P)
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Reformulating the problem =====

We wish that our neural network manages to minimize a given cost function.

A reformulation of out equation, (ref{solveode}), must therefore be done,
such that it describes the problem a neural network can solve for.

The neural network must find the set of weights and biases $P$ such that the trial solution in (ref{trial}) satisfies (ref{solveode}).

The trial solution

!bt
g_t(x, P) = g_0 + x \cdot N(x, P)
!et

has been chosen such that it already solves the condition $g(0) = g_0$. What remains, is to find $P$ such that

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{nnmin}
g_t'(x, P) = - \gamma g_t(x, P)
\end{equation}
!et

is fulfilled as *best as possible*.

!split
===== More technicalities =====

The left hand side and right hand side of (ref{nnmin}) must be computed separately, and then the neural network must choose weights and biases, contained in $P$, such that the sides are equal as best as possible.
This means that the absolute or squared difference between the sides must be as close to zero, ideally equal to zero.
In this case, the difference squared shows to be an appropriate measurement of how erroneous the trial solution is with respect to $P$ of the neural network.

This gives the following cost function our neural network must solve for:

!bt
\min_{P}\Big\{ \big(g_t'(x, P) - ( -\gamma g_t(x, P) \big)^2 \Big\}
!et

(the notation $\min_{P}\{ f(x, P) \}$ means that we desire to find $P$ that yields the minimum of $f(x, P)$)

or, in terms of weights and biases for the hidden and output layer in our network:

!bt
\min_{P_{\text{hidden} }, \ P_{\text{output} }}\Big\{ \big(g_t'(x, \{ P_{\text{hidden} }, P_{\text{output} }\}) - ( -\gamma g_t(x, \{ P_{\text{hidden} }, P_{\text{output} }\}) \big)^2 \Big\}
!et

for an input value $x$.

!split
=====  More details =====

If the neural network evaluates $g_t(x, P)$ at more values for $x$, say $N$ values $x_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, N$, then the *total* error to minimize becomes

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{min}
\min_{P}\Big\{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N  \big(g_t'(x_i, P) - ( -\gamma g_t(x_i, P) \big)^2 \Big\}
\end{equation}
!et

Letting $\bm{x}$ be a vector with elements $x_i$ and $C(\bm{x}, P) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i  \big(g_t'(x_i, P) - ( -\gamma g_t(x_i, P) \big)^2$ denote the cost function, the minimization problem that our network must solve, becomes

!bt
\min_{P} C(\bm{x}, P)
!et

In terms of $P_{\text{hidden} }$ and $P_{\text{output} }$, this could also be expressed as

$$
\min_{P_{\text{hidden} }, \ P_{\text{output} }} C(\bm{x}, \{P_{\text{hidden} }, P_{\text{output} }\})
$$

!split
===== A possible implementation of a neural network =====

For simplicity, it is assumed that the input is an array $\bm{x} = (x_1, \dots, x_N)$ with $N$ elements. It is at these points the neural network should find $P$ such that it fulfills (ref{min}).

First, the neural network must feed forward the inputs.
This means that $\bm{x}s$ must be passed through an input layer, a hidden layer and a output layer. The input layer in this case, does not need to process the data any further.
The input layer will consist of $N_{\text{input} }$ neurons, passing its element to each neuron in the hidden layer.  The number of neurons in the hidden layer will be $N_{\text{hidden} }$.

!split
===== Technicalities =====

For the $i$-th in the hidden layer with weight $w_i^{\text{hidden} }$ and bias $b_i^{\text{hidden} }$, the weighting from the $j$-th neuron at the input layer is:

!bt
\begin{aligned}
z_{i,j}^{\text{hidden}} &= b_i^{\text{hidden}} + w_i^{\text{hidden}}x_j \\
&=
\begin{pmatrix}
b_i^{\text{hidden}} & w_i^{\text{hidden}}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
x_j
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
!et

!split
=====  Final technicalities I =====

The result after weighting the inputs at the $i$-th hidden neuron can be written as a vector:

!bt
\begin{aligned}
\bm{z}_{i}^{\text{hidden}} &= \Big( b_i^{\text{hidden}} + w_i^{\text{hidden}}x_1 , \ b_i^{\text{hidden}} + w_i^{\text{hidden}} x_2, \ \dots \, , \ b_i^{\text{hidden}} + w_i^{\text{hidden}} x_N\Big)  \\
&=
\begin{pmatrix}
 b_i^{\text{hidden}}  & w_i^{\text{hidden}}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1  & 1 & \dots & 1 \\
x_1 & x_2 & \dots & x_N
\end{pmatrix} \\
&= \bm{p}_{i, \text{hidden}}^T X
\end{aligned}
!et

!split
=====  Final technicalities II =====

The vector $\bm{p}_{i, \text{hidden}}^T$ constitutes each row in $P_{\text{hidden} }$, which contains the weights for the neural network to minimize according to (ref{min}).

After having found $\bm{z}_{i}^{\text{hidden}} $ for every $i$-th neuron within the hidden layer, the vector will be sent to an activation function $a_i(\bm{z})$.

In this example, the sigmoid function has been chosen to be the activation function for each hidden neuron:

!bt
f(z) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp{(-z)}}
!et

It is possible to use other activations functions for the hidden layer also.

The output $\bm{x}_i^{\text{hidden}}$ from each $i$-th hidden neuron is:

$$
\bm{x}_i^{\text{hidden} } = f\big(  \bm{z}_{i}^{\text{hidden}} \big)
$$

The outputs $\bm{x}_i^{\text{hidden} } $ are then sent to the output layer.

The output layer consists of one neuron in this case, and combines the
output from each of the neurons in the hidden layers. The output layer
combines the results from the hidden layer using some weights $w_i^{\text{output}}$
and biases $b_i^{\text{output}}$. In this case,
it is assumes that the number of neurons in the output layer is one.

!split
=====  Final technicalities III =====


The procedure of weighting the output neuron $j$ in the hidden layer to the $i$-th neuron in the output layer is similar as for the hidden layer described previously.

!bt
\begin{aligned}
z_{1,j}^{\text{output}} & =
\begin{pmatrix}
b_1^{\text{output}} & \bm{w}_1^{\text{output}}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
\bm{x}_j^{\text{hidden}}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
!et

!split
=====  Final technicalities IV =====

Expressing $z_{1,j}^{\text{output}}$ as a vector gives the following way of weighting the inputs from the hidden layer:

!bt
\bm{z}_{1}^{\text{output}} =
\begin{pmatrix}
b_1^{\text{output}} & \bm{w}_1^{\text{output}}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1  & 1 & \dots & 1 \\
\bm{x}_1^{\text{hidden}} & \bm{x}_2^{\text{hidden}} & \dots & \bm{x}_N^{\text{hidden}}
\end{pmatrix}
!et

In this case we seek a continuous range of values since we are approximating a function. This means that after computing $\bm{z}_{1}^{\text{output}}$ the neural network has finished its feed forward step, and $\bm{z}_{1}^{\text{output}}$ is the final output of the network.

!split
===== Back propagation =====

The next step is to decide how the parameters should be changed such that they minimize the cost function.

The chosen cost function for this problem is

!bt
C(\bm{x}, P) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i  \big(g_t'(x_i, P) - ( -\gamma g_t(x_i, P) \big)^2
!et

In order to minimize the cost function, an optimization method must be chosen.

Here, gradient descent with a constant step size has been chosen.

!split
===== Gradient descent =====

The idea of the gradient descent algorithm is to update parameters in
a direction where the cost function decreases goes to a minimum.

In general, the update of some parameters $\bm{\omega}$ given a cost
function defined by some weights $\bm{\omega}$, $C(\bm{x},
\bm{\omega})$, goes as follows:

!bt
\bm{\omega}_{\text{new} } = \bm{\omega} - \lambda \nabla_{\bm{\omega}} C(\bm{x}, \bm{\omega})
!et

for a number of iterations or until $ \big|\big| \bm{\omega}_{\text{new} } - \bm{\omega} \big|\big|$ becomes smaller than some given tolerance.

The value of $\lambda$ decides how large steps the algorithm must take
in the direction of $ \nabla_{\bm{\omega}} C(\bm{x}, \bm{\omega})$.
The notation $\nabla_{\bm{\omega}}$ express the gradient with respect
to the elements in $\bm{\omega}$.

In our case, we have to minimize the cost function $C(\bm{x}, P)$ with
respect to the two sets of weights and biases, that is for the hidden
layer $P_{\text{hidden} }$ and for the output layer $P_{\text{output}
}$ .

This means that $P_{\text{hidden} }$ and $P_{\text{output} }$ is updated by

!bt
\begin{aligned}
P_{\text{hidden},\text{new}} &= P_{\text{hidden}} - \lambda \nabla_{P_{\text{hidden}}} C(\bm{x}, P)  \\
P_{\text{output},\text{new}} &= P_{\text{output}} - \lambda \nabla_{P_{\text{output}}} C(\bm{x}, P)
\end{aligned}
!et

===== Example: Population growth, comparing Autograd, and Euler's scheme =====

A logistic model of population growth assumes that a population converges toward an equilibrium.
The population growth can be modeled by

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{log}
	g'(t) = \alpha g(t)(A - g(t))
\end{equation}
!et

where $g(t)$ is the population density at time $t$, $\alpha > 0$ the growth rate and $A > 0$ is the maximum population number in the environment.
Also, at $t = 0$ the population has the size $g(0) = g_0$, where $g_0$ is some chosen constant.

In this example, similar network as for the exponential decay using Autograd has been used to solve the equation. However, as the implementation might suffer from e.g numerical instability
and high execution time (this might be more apparent in the examples solving PDEs),
a network has been constructed using TensorFlow also.
For comparison, the forward Euler method has been implemented in order to see how the networks performs compared to a numerical scheme.

!split
===== Setting up the problem =====

Here, we will model a population $g(t)$ in an environment having carrying capacity $A$.
The population follows the model

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{solveode_population}
g'(t) = \alpha g(t)(A - g(t))
\end{equation}
!et

where $g(0) = g_0$.

In this example, we let $\alpha = 2$, $A = 1$, and $g_0 = 1.2$.

!split
===== The trial solution =====

We will get a slightly different trial solution, as the boundary conditions are different
compared to the case for exponential decay.

A possible trial solution satisfying the condition $g(0) = g_0$ could be

$$
h_1(t) = g_0 + t \cdot N(t,P)
$$

with $N(t,P)$ being the output from the neural network with weights and biases for each layer collected in the set $P$.

The analytical solution is

$$
g(t) = \frac{Ag_0}{g_0 + (A - g_0)\exp(-\alpha A t)}
$$

The network will be the similar as for the exponential decay example, but with some small modifications for our problem.

===== Using forward Euler to solve the ODE =====

A straight-forward way of solving an ODE numerically, is to use Euler's method.

Euler's method uses Taylor series to approximate the value at a function $f$ at a step $\Delta x$ from $x$:

$$
f(x + \Delta x) \approx f(x) + \Delta x f'(x)
$$

In our case, using Euler's method to approximate the value of $g$ at a step $\Delta t$ from $t$ yields

!bt
\begin{aligned}
  g(t + \Delta t) &\approx g(t) + \Delta t g'(t) \\
  &= g(t) + \Delta t \big(\alpha g(t)(A - g(t))\big)
\end{aligned}
!et
along with the condition that $g(0) = g_0$.

Let $t_i = i \cdot \Delta t$ where $\Delta t = \frac{T}{N_t-1}$ where $T$ is the final time our solver must solve for and $N_t$ the number of values for $t \in [0, T]$ for $i = 0, \dots, N_t-1$.

For $i \geq 1$, we have that
!bt
\begin{aligned}
t_i &= i\Delta t \\
&= (i - 1)\Delta t + \Delta t \\
&= t_{i-1} + \Delta t
\end{aligned}
!et

Now, if $g_i = g(t_i)$ then

!bt
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  g_i &= g(t_i) \\
  &= g(t_{i-1} + \Delta t) \\
  &\approx g(t_{i-1}) + \Delta t \big(\alpha g(t_{i-1})(A - g(t_{i-1}))\big) \\
  &= g_{i-1} + \Delta t \big(\alpha g_{i-1}(A - g_{i-1})\big)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation} \label{odenum}
!et
for $i \geq 1$ and $g_0 = g(t_0) = g(0) = g_0$.

Equation (ref{odenum}) could be implemented in the following way,
extending the program that uses the network using Autograd:

===== Using TensorFlow  =====

TensorFlow is a library widely used in the machine learning community.
  
Tensorflow is an open source library machine learning library
developed by the Google Brain team for internal use. It was released
under the Apache 2.0 open source license in November 9, 2015.
  
Tensorflow is a computational framework that allows you to construct
machine learning models at different levels of abstraction, from
high-level, object-oriented APIs like Keras, down to the C++ kernels
that Tensorflow is built upon. The higher levels of abstraction are
simpler to use, but less flexible, and our choice of implementation
should reflect the problems we are trying to solve.
  

  
To install tensorflow on Unix/Linux systems, use pip as
!bc pycod
pip3 install tensorflow
!ec
and/or if you use _anaconda_, just write (or install from the graphical user interface)
(current release of CPU-only TensorFlow)
!bc pycod 
conda create -n tf tensorflow
conda activate tf
!ec
To install the current release of GPU TensorFlow
!bc pycod
conda create -n tf-gpu tensorflow-gpu
conda activate tf-gpu
!ec

!split
===== Using Keras =====
  
Keras is a high level "neural network":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface"
that supports Tensorflow, CTNK and Theano as backends.  
If you have Anaconda installed you may run the following command
!bc pycod
conda install keras
!ec
