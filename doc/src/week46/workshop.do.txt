===== project 3 workshop =====

We have tried every year to organize a kind of mini-workshop on project 3. In 2020 the contributions were (and some of these ended up in thesis work and/or publications!)

* Maria Emine Nylund: _Lego Bricks Classifier_
* Fabio Rodrigues Pereira: _Financial Machine Learning_
* Markus Borud Pettersen: _Machine Learning and Brain Grid Cells_
* Jing Sun and Endrias Getachew Asgedom: _Machine learning-based approaches to denoising microseismic data_
* Felicia Jacobsen: _Analysis of Breast Cancer Data_
* Simon Elias Schrader: _Predicting atomization energies of molecules_
* Varvara Bazilova and Sergio Andres Diaz Mesa: _Glacier Mapping and Machine Learning_
* Gert Werner Kluge, Hanna Alida Fossen Hardersen and Sushma Sharma Adhikari: _Gamma ray signals stemming from dark matter in the galactic center_

=====  Workshop topics 2021  =====

o _1215-1225pm_: Are Frode Helvig Kvanum, Gard HÃ¸ivang, and David Andreas Bordvik, *Next-day forecasts on spot prices for electricity*
o _1225-1235pm_: Lidia Luque, *Voxel-wise multi-label brain tumor classification*
o _1235-1245pm_: Marcus Berget et al, *Locating suspicious brain activity using neural networks*
o _1245-1255pm_: William Ho and Tom-Ruben Traavik Kvalvaag, *Comparing semi-supervised learning and supervised learning for image classification*
We would very much like to organize something similar this year as well. Feel free to come with sugesstions by Thursday November 17. We will then try to set up the various contributions for Friday November 18.
The presentations last normally 5-15 mins and span from loose ideas to more well-defined topics. Nothing pretentious, we wish to keep this as low-key as possible.
