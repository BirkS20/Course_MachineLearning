    "# Resampling Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling methods are an indispensable tool in modern\n",
    "statistics. They involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training\n",
    "set and refitting a model of interest on each sample in order to\n",
    "obtain additional information about the fitted model. For example, in\n",
    "order to estimate the variability of a linear regression fit, we can\n",
    "repeatedly draw different samples from the training data, fit a linear\n",
    "regression to each new sample, and then examine the extent to which\n",
    "the resulting fits differ. Such an approach may allow us to obtain\n",
    "information that would not be available from fitting the model only\n",
    "once using the original training sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two resampling methods are often used in Machine Learning analyses,\n",
    "1. The **bootstrap method**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. and **Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition there are several other methods such as the Jackknife and the Blocking methods. We will discuss in particular\n",
    "cross-validation and the bootstrap method. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive, because they\n",
    "involve fitting the same statistical method multiple times using\n",
    "different subsets of the training data. However, due to recent\n",
    "advances in computing power, the computational requirements of\n",
    "resampling methods generally are not prohibitive. In this chapter, we\n",
    "discuss two of the most commonly used resampling methods,\n",
    "cross-validation and the bootstrap. Both methods are important tools\n",
    "in the practical application of many statistical learning\n",
    "procedures. For example, cross-validation can be used to estimate the\n",
    "test error associated with a given statistical learning method in\n",
    "order to evaluate its performance, or to select the appropriate level\n",
    "of flexibility. The process of evaluating a modelâ€™s performance is\n",
    "known as model assessment, whereas the process of selecting the proper\n",
    "level of flexibility for a model is known as model selection. The\n",
    "bootstrap is widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our simulations can be treated as *computer experiments*. This is particularly the case for Monte Carlo methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* The results can be analysed with the same statistical tools as we would use analysing experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As in all experiments, we are looking for expectation values and an estimate of how accurate they are, i.e., possible sources for errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reminder on Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* As in other experiments, many numerical  experiments have two classes of errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Statistical errors\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Systematical errors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Statistical errors can be estimated using standard tools from statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Systematical errors are method specific and must be treated differently from case to case. \n",
    "\n",
    "The\n",
    "advantage of doing linear regression is that we actually end up with\n",
    "analytical expressions for several statistical quantities.  \n",
    "Standard least squares and Ridge regression  allow us to\n",
    "derive quantities like the variance and other expectation values in a\n",
    "rather straightforward way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
