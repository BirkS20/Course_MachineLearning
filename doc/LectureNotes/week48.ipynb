    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. \n",
    "In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,\n",
    "and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*\n",
    "is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm \n",
    "of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, \n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.\n",
    "Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",

    "autoencoders work by simply learning to copy their inputs to their\n",
    "outputs. This may sound like a trivial task, but we will see that\n",
