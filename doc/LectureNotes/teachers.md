## Grading
Grading scale: Grades are awarded on a scale from A to F, where A is the best grade and F is a fail. There are three projects which are graded and each project counts 1/3 of the final grade. The total score is thus the average from all three projects.

The final number of points is based on the average of all projects (including eventual additional points) and the grade follows the following table:

 * 92-100 points: A
 * 77-91 points: B
 * 58-76 points: C
 * 46-57 points: D
 * 40-45 points: E
 * 0-39 points: F-failed
