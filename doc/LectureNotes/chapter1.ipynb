    "\n",
    "Statistics, data science and machine learning form important fields of\n",
    "research in modern science.  They describe how to learn and make\n",
    "predictions from data, as well as allowing us to extract important\n",
    "correlations about physical process and the underlying laws of motion\n",
    "in large data sets. The latter, big data sets, appear frequently in\n",
    "essentially all disciplines, from the traditional Science, Technology,\n",
    "Mathematics and Engineering fields to Life Science, Law, education\n",
    "research, the Humanities and the Social Sciences. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has become more\n",
    "and more common to see research projects on big data in for example\n",
    "the Social Sciences where extracting patterns from complicated survey\n",
    "data is one of many research directions.  Having a solid grasp of data\n",
    "analysis and machine learning is thus becoming central to scientific\n",
    "computing in many fields, and competences and skills within the fields\n",
    "of machine learning and scientific computing are nowadays strongly\n",
    "requested by many potential employers. The latter cannot be\n",
    "overstated, familiarity with machine learning has almost become a\n",
    "prerequisite for many of the most exciting employment opportunities,\n",
    "whether they are in bioinformatics, life science, physics or finance,\n",
    "in the private or the public sector. This author has had several\n",
    "students or met students who have been hired recently based on their\n",
    "skills and competences in scientific computing and data science, often\n",
    "with marginal knowledge of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of computer science, and is closely\n",
    "related to computational statistics.  It evolved from the study of\n",
    "pattern recognition in artificial intelligence (AI) research, and has\n",
    "made contributions to AI tasks like computer vision, natural language\n",
    "processing and speech recognition. Many of the methods we will study are also \n",
    "strongly rooted in basic mathematics and physics research. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, machine learning represents the science of giving computers\n",
    "the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  The idea is\n",
    "that there exist generic algorithms which can be used to find patterns\n",
    "in a broad class of data sets without having to write code\n",
    "specifically for each problem. The algorithm will build its own logic\n",
    "based on the data.  You should however always keep in mind that\n",
    "machines and algorithms are to a large extent developed by humans. The\n",
    "insights and knowledge we have about a specific system, play a central\n",
    "role when we develop a specific machine learning algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is an extremely rich field, in spite of its young\n",
    "age. The increases we have seen during the last three decades in\n",
    "computational capabilities have been followed by developments of\n",
    "methods and techniques for analyzing and handling large data sets,\n",
    "relying heavily on statistics, computer science and mathematics.  The\n",
    "field is rather new and developing rapidly. Popular software packages\n",
    "written in Python for machine learning like\n",
    "[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/),\n",
    "[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),\n",
    "[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/), all\n",
    "freely available at their respective GitHub sites, encompass\n",
    "communities of developers in the thousands or more. And the number of\n",
    "code developers and contributors keeps increasing. Not all the\n",
    "algorithms and methods can be given a rigorous mathematical\n",
    "justification, opening up thereby large rooms for experimenting and\n",
    "trial and error and thereby exciting new developments.  However, a\n",
    "solid command of linear algebra, multivariate theory, probability\n",
    "theory, statistical data analysis, understanding errors and Monte\n",
    "Carlo methods are central elements in a proper understanding of many\n",
    "of algorithms and methods we will discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into\n",
    "two main categories.  In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a\n",
    "problem, and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other\n",
    "hand, *unsupervised learning* is a method for finding patterns and\n",
    "relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authors also operate with a third category, namely\n",
    "*reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm of learning inspired by\n",
    "behavioral psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error,\n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the\n",
    "desired output of a system.  Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods we cover have three main topics in common, irrespective of\n",
    "whether we deal with supervised or unsupervised learning.\n",
    "* The first ingredient is normally our data set (which can be subdivided into training, validation  and test data). Many find the most difficult part of using Machine Learning to be the set up of your data in a meaningful way. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The second item is a model which is normally a function of some parameters.  The model reflects our knowledge of the system (or lack thereof). As an example, if we know that our data show a behavior similar to what would be predicted by a polynomial, fitting our data to a polynomial of some degree would then determin our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The last ingredient is a so-called **cost/loss** function (or error or risk function) which allows us to present an estimate on how good our model is in reproducing the data it is supposed to train.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of basically all Machine Learning algorithms we will encounter so-called minimization or optimization algorithms. A large family of such methods are so-called **gradient methods**."

    "### What is a good model?\n",
    "\n",
    "In science and engineering we often end up in situations where we want to infer (or learn) a\n",
    "quantitative model $M$ for a given set of sample points $\\boldsymbol{X} \\in [x_1, x_2,\\dots x_N]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see repeatedly in these lectures, we could try to fit these data points to a model given by a\n",
    "straight line, or if we wish to be more sophisticated to a more complex\n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for inferring such a model is that it\n",
    "serves many useful purposes. On the one hand, the model can reveal information\n",
    "encoded in the data or underlying mechanisms from which the data were generated. For instance, we could discover important\n",
    "correlations that relate interesting physics interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it can simplify the representation of the given data set and help\n",
    "us in making predictions about  future data samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A first important consideration to keep in mind is that inferring the *correct* model\n",
    "for a given data set is an elusive, if not impossible, task. The fundamental difficulty\n",
    "is that if we are not specific about what we mean by a *correct* model, there\n",

    "optimal for a given data set? To make the model inference problem well posed, i.e.,\n",
    "to guarantee that there is a unique optimal model for the given data, we need to\n",
    "impose additional assumptions or restrictions on the class of models considered. To\n",
    "this end, we should not be looking for just any model that can describe the data.\n",
    "Instead, we should look for a **model** $M$ that is the best among a restricted class\n",
    "of models. In addition, to make the model inference problem computationally\n",
    "tractable, we need to specify how restricted the class of models needs to be. A\n",
    "common strategy is to start \n",
    "with the simplest possible class of models that is just necessary to describe the data\n",
    "or solve the problem at hand. More precisely, the model class should be rich enough\n",

    "restricted enough that it is relatively simple to find the best model for the given data.\n",

    "simpler models become inadequate. For instance, if we work with a regression problem to fit a set of sample points, one\n",

This contribution is proportional to the volume.\n",

The assumption here is that a nucleon at the surface of a nucleus interacts with fewer other nucleons than one in the interior of the nucleus and hence its binding energy is less. This surface energy term takes that into account and is therefore negative and is proportional to the surface area.\n",

    "Many Machine Learning problems involve thousands or even millions of\n",
    "features for each training instance. Not only does this make training\n",
    "extremely slow, it can also make it much harder to find a good\n",
    "solution, as we will see. This problem is often referred to as the\n",
    "curse of dimensionality.  Fortunately, in real-world problems, it is\n",
    "often possible to reduce the number of features considerably, turning\n",
    "an intractable problem into a tractable one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later  we will discuss some of the most popular dimensionality reduction\n",
    "techniques: the principal component analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA, and\n",
    "Locally Linear Embedding (LLE).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis and its various variants deal with the\n",
    "problem of fitting a low-dimensional [affine\n",
    "subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space) to a set of of\n",
    "data points in a high-dimensional space. With its family of methods it\n",
    "is one of the most used tools in data modeling, compression and\n",
    "visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed however, we will discuss how to preprocess our\n",
    "data. Till now and in connection with our previous examples we have\n",
    "not met so many cases where we are too sensitive to the scaling of our\n",
    "data. Normally the data may need a rescaling and/or may be sensitive\n",
    "to extreme values. Scaling the data renders our inputs much more\n",
    "suitable for the algorithms we want to employ.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data sets gathered for real world applications, it is rather normal that\n",
    "different features have very different units and\n",
    "numerical scales. For example, a data set detailing health habits may include\n",
    "features such as **age** in the range $0-80$, and **caloric intake** of order $2000$.\n",
    "Many machine learning methods sensitive to the scales of the features and may perform poorly if they\n",
    "are very different scales. Therefore, it is typical to scale\n",
    "the features in a way to avoid such outlier values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scikit-Learn** has several functions which allow us to rescale the\n",
    "data, normally resulting in much better results in terms of various\n",
    "accuracy scores.  The **StandardScaler** function in **Scikit-Learn**\n",
    "ensures that for each feature/predictor we study the mean value is\n",
    "zero and the variance is one (every column in the design/feature\n",
    "matrix).  This scaling has the drawback that it does not ensure that\n",
    "we have a particular maximum or minimum in our data set. Another\n",
    "function included in **Scikit-Learn** is the **MinMaxScaler** which\n",
    "ensures that all features are exactly between $0$ and $1$. The\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Normalizer** scales each data\n",
    "point such that the feature vector has a euclidean length of one. In other words, it\n",
    "projects a data point on the circle (or sphere in the case of higher dimensions) with a\n",
    "radius of 1. This means every data point is scaled by a different number (by the\n",
    "inverse of it’s length).\n",
    "This normalization is often used when only the direction (or angle) of the data matters,\n",
    "not the length of the feature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **RobustScaler** works similarly to the StandardScaler in that it\n",
    "ensures statistical properties for each feature that guarantee that\n",
    "they are on the same scale. However, the RobustScaler uses the median\n",
    "and quartiles, instead of mean and variance. This makes the\n",
    "RobustScaler ignore data points that are very different from the rest\n",
    "(like measurement errors). These odd data points are also called\n",
    "outliers, and might often lead to trouble for other scaling\n",
    "techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many features are often scaled using standardization to improve\n",
    "performance. In **Scikit-Learn** this is given by the **StandardScaler**\n",
    "function as discussed above. It is easy however to write your own.\n",
